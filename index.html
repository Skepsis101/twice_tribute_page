                <h2>Here are some fun facts about the members:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sana and Momo were both accepted into JYP at the same time and even traveled from Japan to Korea together. They dormed together as trainees and Sana said on a vLive that she cannot remember a single time the two of them fought, even back then.</li>
                        <li>Mina and Dahyun are attributed to be the smartest/best in school of all the members. Even though she's clumsy and a bit ditzy, Sana's knack for learning languages and picking up on cultural differences show that she's smarter than people assume (or, at the very least, just excels in this particular zone).</li>
                        <li>TWICE was originally supposed to be 7 members at the end of Sixteen - Jihyo, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung. Tzuyu was added in as the audience vote, and JYP himself personally brought Momo back from elimination to join. While it's impossible to think of the group without the two of them now, at the time there was lots of backlash for them allowing eliminated members to debut.</li>
                        <li>TWICE all lives in the same dorm/house. The maknaes (Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu) share one room, Jeongyeon and Momo share the smallest room, and Jihyo, Nayeon, Mina, and Sana share the largest room. They've recently moved dorms and there's a possibility this living arrangement has changed slightly (though I do know that Jeongyeon and Momo still share a room).</li>
                        <li>Half of them have really weird sleeping habits. The members voted the large room (even those who sleep in it) as the room with the worst habits. Nayeon sleeps with her eyes open and often laughs and sings in her sleep, Jihyo will pick up her phone and have conversations, and Sana will lightly sleepwalk. Momo will stretch out and often sleeps with her eyes open as well. Tzuyu, while rare, will speak small words while sleeping. Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Jeongyeon, and Mina don't really do much - though Dahyun is the heaviest sleeper and Chaeyoung sleeps the most.</li>
